################################################################################
INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.

<ROLE>
Your primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.
* If the user asks a question, like "why is X happening", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.
</ROLE>

<EFFICIENCY>
* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.
* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.
</EFFICIENCY>

<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>
* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.
* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.
* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.
* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:
  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes
  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works
  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version
* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it
* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions
</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>

<CODE_QUALITY>
* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.
* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.
* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.
* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.
* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).
* If working in a git repo, before you commit code create a .gitignore file if one doesn't exist. And if there are existing files that should not be included then update the .gitignore file as appropriate.
</CODE_QUALITY>

<VERSION_CONTROL>
* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.
* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.
</VERSION_CONTROL>

<PULL_REQUESTS>
* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.
* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.
</PULL_REQUESTS>

<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>
1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions
2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one
3. TESTING:
   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes
   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate
   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes
   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure
   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies
4. IMPLEMENTATION:
   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem
   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes
   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works
5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.
</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>

<SECURITY>
* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.
* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.
</SECURITY>

<SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>
# 🔐 Security Risk Policy
When using tools that support the security_risk parameter, assess the safety risk of your actions:


- **LOW**: Read-only actions inside sandbox.
  - Inspecting container files, calculations, viewing docs.
- **MEDIUM**: Container-scoped edits and installs.
  - Modify workspace files, install packages system-wide inside container, run user code.
- **HIGH**: Data exfiltration or privilege breaks.
  - Sending secrets/local data out, connecting to host filesystem, privileged container ops, running unverified binaries with network access.



**Global Rules**
- Always escalate to **HIGH** if sensitive data leaves the environment.
</SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>

<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>
* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.
* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.
</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>

<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>
* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.
* If you encounter missing dependencies:
  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)
  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed
* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.
</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>

<TROUBLESHOOTING>
* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:
  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause
  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability
  4. Document your reasoning process
* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.
</TROUBLESHOOTING>

<DOCUMENTATION>
* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:
  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files
  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested
  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes
* If the user asks for documentation:
  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation
  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control
</DOCUMENTATION>

<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>
* When terminating processes:
  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes
  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process
  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID
  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands
</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>

<TASK_MANAGEMENT>
* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.
* It is crucial that you update task status to "done" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.
* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:
  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`
  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units
  3. Update tasks to "in_progress" status when commencing work on them
  4. Update tasks to "done" status immediately after completing each item
  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements
  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding
* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:
  ```
  User: "Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures"
  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:
  - Execute the test suite
  - Resolve any validation failures
  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.
  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]
  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.
  [Updating first task to in_progress]
  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...
  [After resolving first failure]
  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...
  ```
* Example workflow for component development:
  ```
  User: "Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options"
  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.
  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:
  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements
  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture
  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity
  4. Create filtering and search functionality
  5. Integrate components and perform testing
  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...
  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]
  ```
</TASK_MANAGEMENT>

<TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>
* IMPORTANT: If you were using the task_tracker tool before a condensation event, continue using it after condensation
* Check condensation summaries for TASK_TRACKING sections to maintain continuity
* If you see a condensation event with TASK_TRACKING, immediately use task_tracker to view and continue managing them
</TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.


### Command Execution
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.
* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)
* Shell options: Do NOT use `set -e`, `set -eu`, or `set -euo pipefail` in shell scripts or commands in this environment. The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions. If you want to run multi-line bash commands, write the commands to a file and then run it, instead.

### Long-running Commands
* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the "timeout" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.
* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:
  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs
  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process
  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process
  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer "timeout" parameter to let it run to completion

### Best Practices
* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.
* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.

### Output Handling
* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional. Sets a hard timeout in seconds for the command execution. If not provided, the command will use the default soft timeout behavior.
  (4) security_risk (string, required): The LLM's assessment of the safety risk of this action. See the SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT section in the system prompt for risk level definitions.
Allowed values: [`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: think ----
Description: Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.

Common use cases:
1. When exploring a repository and discovering the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.
2. After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.
3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.
4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.
5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.

The tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.
Parameters:
  (1) thought (string, required): The thought to log.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: finish ----
Description: Signals the completion of the current task or conversation.

Use this tool when:
- You have successfully completed the user's requested task
- You cannot proceed further due to technical limitations or missing information

The message should include:
- A clear summary of actions taken and their results
- Any next steps for the user
- Explanation if you're unable to complete the task
- Any follow-up questions if more information is needed

Parameters:
  (1) message (string, required): Final message to send to the user
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #4: task_tracker ----
Description: This tool provides structured task management capabilities for development workflows.
It enables systematic tracking of work items, progress monitoring, and efficient
organization of complex development activities.

The tool maintains visibility into project status and helps communicate
progress effectively to users.

## Application Guidelines

Utilize this tool in the following situations:

1. Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or
   parallel activities
2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and
   coordination across multiple components
3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask
   for structured task management
4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items
   that need coordination
5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start
6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning
   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task
7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work
   that emerged during implementation

## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary

Avoid using this tool when:

1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition
2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value
3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps
4. Pure information exchange or discussion

Note: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation
rather than creating tracking overhead.

## Usage Scenarios

**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**
User request: "Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.
Don't forget to include input validation and error handling!"

Response approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive
validation. Let me organize this work systematically.

*Task breakdown includes:*
1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models
2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management
3. Add client-side form validation and error display
4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks
5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases
6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues

**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**
User request: "I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to
'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project"

Response approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations
where 'fetchData' appears.

*After code analysis*

I've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.
I'll create a systematic plan to update these references.

*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*

**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**
User request: "Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,
article management, comment system, and user profiles."

Response approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these
components into manageable implementation phases.

*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*

## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred

**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**
User request: "What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?"

Response approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    console.log(array[i]);
}
```

*No task tracking needed - single informational response*

**Counter-example B: Minor modification**
User request: "Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining
its parameters."

Response approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.

*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*

## Status Management and Workflow

1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:
   - todo: Not yet initiated
   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)
   - done: Successfully completed

2. **Workflow Practices**:
   - Update status dynamically as work progresses
   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish
   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time
   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones
   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely

3. **Completion Criteria**:
   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved
   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist
   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies
   - Never mark done when:
       - Test suites are failing
       - Implementation remains incomplete
       - Unresolved errors persist
       - Required resources are unavailable

4. **Task Organization**:
   - Write precise, actionable descriptions
   - Decompose complex work into manageable units
   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions

When uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates
systematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress. Always `view` the current list before making changes.
Allowed values: [`view`, `plan`]
  (2) task_list (array, optional): The full task list. Required parameter of `plan` command.
---- END FUNCTION #4 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #5: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a text file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The following binary file extensions can be viewed in Markdown format: [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".wav", ".mp3", ".m4a", ".flac", ".pdf", ".docx"]. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
* This tool can be used for creating and editing files in plain-text format.


Before using this tool:
1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context
2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):
   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location

When making edits:
   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code
   - Do not leave the code in a broken state
   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:

1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.

2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:
   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)
   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed

3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.

Remember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
  (8) security_risk (string, required): The LLM's assessment of the safety risk of this action. See the SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT section in the system prompt for risk level definitions.
Allowed values: [`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`]

/workspace/django__django__3.1
</uploaded_files>

I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__3.1. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
docutils reports an error rendering view docstring when the first line is not empty
Description
	
Currently admindoc works correctly only with docstrings where the first line is empty, and all Django docstrings are formatted in this way.
However usually the docstring text starts at the first line, e.g.:
def test():
	"""test tests something.
	"""
and this cause an error:
Error in "default-role" directive:
no content permitted.
.. default-role:: cmsreference
The culprit is this code in trim_docstring:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
The problem is that the indentation of the first line is 0.
The solution is to skip the first line:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
Thanks.

</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/django__django__3.1 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.

Follow these phases to resolve the issue:

Phase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms
   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.
   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.
   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.
   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.
   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue

Phase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository
   2.1 Follow the readme
   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed
   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests

Phase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions
   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.
   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.
   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.
   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.

Phase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.
   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.
   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.
   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.
   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.

Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it
   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.
   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.
   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.
   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.
   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.

Phase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.
   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.

Phase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.
   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.
   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.
   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.

8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit e8fcdaad5c428878d0a5d6ba820d957013f75595.
   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.
   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:
     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing
     8.2.2 The files you modified
     8.2.3 The functions you changed
   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass

Be thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
I understand the problem. The `admindoc` feature in Django currently fails to render docstrings correctly if the first line is not empty, leading to a `docutils` error. This is because the `trim_docstring` function incorrectly calculates the minimum indentation by including the first line, which often has zero indentation. The proposed solution is to modify `trim_docstring` to skip the first line when determining the overall indentation.

I will follow the outlined phases to address this issue:

**Phase 1. READING:**
The problem is that `admindoc` in Django incorrectly processes docstrings where the first line contains text, leading to a `docutils` error: "Error in "default-role" directive: no content permitted." This happens because the `trim_docstring` function, which removes common leading whitespace from docstrings, calculates the minimum indentation by considering all lines, including the first line (which usually has no leading whitespace if the text starts immediately). This effectively sets the minimum indentation to 0, preventing proper trimming and causing the rendering error. The fix involves ensuring the first line is skipped when calculating the common indentation level.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Create a Python function or class with a docstring that starts with text on the first line (not an empty line).
   ```python
   def my_func():
       """This is a test docstring.
       It has some indented content.
       """
       pass
   ```
2. Trigger Django's `admindoc` rendering for this docstring.
3. Observe the `docutils` error "Error in "default-role" directive: no content permitted."

**Best practices for fixing:**
*   Make minimal changes to only fix the indentation calculation in `trim_docstring`.
*   Ensure compatibility with both docstrings that start with an empty line (Django's current convention) and those that start with text on the first line (common Python convention).
*   Create a reproduction script to confirm the bug before applying the fix and verify the fix afterward.

Now, I will proceed with Phase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository. First, I need to list the content of the `django__django__3.1` directory.

Okay, I see the directory structure. It's a standard Django repository.
I'll proceed with Phase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository.

I need to figure out how to install the environment and run the tests. I'll start by looking for a `README.rst` file and `tests/` directory. I've already confirmed the `tests/` directory exists.

     4	
     5	Django comes with a test suite of its own, in the ``tests`` directory of the
     6	code base. It's our policy to make sure all tests pass at all times.
     7	
     8	We appreciate any and all contributions to the test suite!

    15	
    16	Running the unit tests
    17	======================
    18	
    19	Quickstart
    20	----------
    21	
    22	First, `fork Django on GitHub <https://github.com/django/django/fork>`__.
    23	
    24	Second, create and activate a virtual environment. If you're not familiar with
    25	how to do that, read our :doc:`contributing tutorial </intro/contributing>`.
    26	
    27	Next, clone your fork, install some requirements, and run the tests:
    28	
    29	.. console::
    30	
    31	   $ git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubName/django.git django-repo
    32	   $ cd django-repo/tests
    33	   $ python -m pip install -e ..
    34	   $ python -m pip install -r requirements/py3.txt
    35	   $ ./runtests.py
    36	
    37	Installing the requirements will likely require some operating system packages
    38	that your computer doesn't have installed. You can usually figure out which
    39	package to install by doing a Web search for the last line or so of the error
    40	message. Try adding your operating system to the search query if needed.
    41	
    42	If you have trouble installing the requirements, you can skip that step. See
    43	:ref:`running-unit-tests-dependencies` for details on installing the optional
    44	test dependencies. If you don't have an optional dependency installed, the
    45	tests that require it will be skipped.
    46	
    47	Running the tests requires a Django settings module that defines the databases
    48	to use. To help you get started, Django provides and uses a sample settings
    49	module that uses the SQLite database. See :ref:`running-unit-tests-settings` to
    50	learn how to use a different settings module to run the tests with a different
    51	database.
    52	
    53	Having problems? See :ref:`troubleshooting-unit-tests` for some common issues.
    54	
    55	Running tests using ``tox``
    56	---------------------------
    57	
    58	`Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a tool for running tests in different
    59	virtual environments. Django includes a basic ``tox.ini`` that automates some
    60	checks that our build server performs on pull requests. To run the unit tests
    61	and other checks (such as :ref:`import sorting <coding-style-imports>`, the
    62	:ref:`documentation spelling checker <documentation-spelling-check>`, and
    63	:ref:`code formatting <coding-style-python>`), install and run the ``tox``
    64	command from any place in the Django source tree:
    65	
    66	.. console::
    67	
    68	    $ python -m pip install tox
    69	    $ tox
    70	
    71	By default, ``tox`` runs the test suite with the bundled test settings file for
    72	SQLite, ``flake8``, ``isort``, and the documentation spelling checker. In
    73	addition to the system dependencies noted elsewhere in this documentation,
    74	the command ``python3`` must be on your path and linked to the appropriate
    75	version of Python. A list of default environments can be seen as follows:
    76	
    77	.. console::
    78	
    79	    $ tox -l
    80	    py3
    81	    flake8
    82	    docs
    83	    isort
    84	
    85	Testing other Python versions and database backends
    86	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    87	
    88	In addition to the default environments, ``tox`` supports running unit tests
    89	for other versions of Python and other database backends. Since Django's test
    90	suite doesn't bundle a settings file for database backends other than SQLite,
    91	however, you must :ref:`create and provide your own test settings
    92	<running-unit-tests-settings>`. For example, to run the tests on Python 3.7
    93	using PostgreSQL:
    94	
    95	.. console::
    96	
    97	    $ tox -e py37-postgres -- --settings=my_postgres_settings
    98	
    99	This command sets up a Python 3.7 virtual environment, installs Django's
   100	test suite dependencies (including those for PostgreSQL), and calls
   101	``runtests.py`` with the supplied arguments (in this case,
   102	``--settings=my_postgres_settings``).
   103	
   104	The remainder of this documentation shows commands for running tests without
   105	``tox``, however, any option passed to ``runtests.py`` can also be passed to
   106	``tox`` by prefixing the argument list with ``--``, as above.
   107	
   108	Tox also respects the ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable, if set.
   109	For example, the following is equivalent to the command above:
   110	
   111	.. code-block:: console
   112	
   113	    $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=my_postgres_settings tox -e py35-postgres
   114	
   115	Windows users should use:
   116	
   117	.. code-block:: doscon
   118	
   119	    ...\> set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=my_postgres_settings
   120	    ...\> tox -e py35-postgres
   121	
   122	Running the JavaScript tests
   123	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   124	
   125	Django includes a set of :ref:`JavaScript unit tests <javascript-tests>` for
   126	functions in certain contrib apps. The JavaScript tests aren't run by default
   127	using ``tox`` because they require `Node.js` to be installed and aren't
   128	necessary for the majority of patches. To run the JavaScript tests using
   129	``tox``:
   130	
   131	.. console::
   132	
   133	    $ tox -e javascript
   134	
   135	This command runs ``npm install`` to ensure test requirements are up to
   136	date and then runs ``npm test``.
   137	
   138	Running tests using ``django-docker-box``
   139	-----------------------------------------
   140	
   141	`django-docker-box`_ allows you to run the Django's test suite across all
   142	supported databases and python versions. See the `django-docker-box`_ project
   143	page for installation and usage instructions.
   144	
   145	.. _django-docker-box: https://github.com/django/django-docker-box
   146	
   147	.. _running-unit-tests-settings:
   148	
   149	Using another ``settings`` module
   150	---------------------------------
   151	
   152	The included settings module (``tests/test_sqlite.py``) allows you to run the
   153	test suite using SQLite. If you want to run the tests using a different
   154	database, you'll need to define your own settings file. Some tests, such as
   155	those for ``contrib.postgres``, are specific to a particular database backend
   156	and will be skipped if run with a different backend.
   157	
   158	To run the tests with different settings, ensure that the module is on your
   159	``PYTHONPATH`` and pass the module with ``--settings``.
   160	
   161	The :setting:`DATABASES` setting in any test settings module needs to define
   162	two databases:
   163	
   164	* A ``default`` database. This database should use the backend that
   165	  you want to use for primary testing.
   166	
   167	* A database with the alias ``other``. The ``other`` database is used to test
   168	  that queries can be directed to different databases. This database should use
   169	  the same backend as the ``default``, and it must have a different name.
   170	
   171	If you're using a backend that isn't SQLite, you will need to provide other
   172	details for each database:
   173	
   174	* The :setting:`USER` option needs to specify an existing user account
   175	  for the database. That user needs permission to execute ``CREATE DATABASE``
   176	  so that the test database can be created.
   177	
   178	* The :setting:`PASSWORD` option needs to provide the password for
   179	  the :setting:`USER` that has been specified.
   180	
   181	Test databases get their names by prepending ``test_`` to the value of the
   182	:setting:`NAME` settings for the databases defined in :setting:`DATABASES`.
   183	These test databases are deleted when the tests are finished.
   184	
   185	You will also need to ensure that your database uses UTF-8 as the default
   186	character set. If your database server doesn't use UTF-8 as a default charset,
   187	you will need to include a value for :setting:`CHARSET <TEST_CHARSET>` in the
   188	test settings dictionary for the applicable database.
   189	
   190	.. _runtests-specifying-labels:
   191	
   192	Running only some of the tests
   193	------------------------------
   194	
   195	Django's entire test suite takes a while to run, and running every single test
   196	could be redundant if, say, you just added a test to Django that you want to
   197	run quickly without running everything else. You can run a subset of the unit
   198	tests by appending the names of the test modules to ``runtests.py`` on the
   199	command line.
   200	
   201	For example, if you'd like to run tests only for generic relations and
   202	internationalization, type:
   203	
   204	.. console::
   205	
   206	   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings generic_relations i18n
   207	
   208	How do you find out the names of individual tests? Look in ``tests/`` — each
   209	directory name there is the name of a test.
   210	
   211	If you want to run only a particular class of tests, you can specify a list of
   212	paths to individual test classes. For example, to run the ``TranslationTests``
   213	of the ``i18n`` module, type:
   214	
   215	.. console::
   216	
   217	   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings i18n.tests.TranslationTests
   218	
   219	Going beyond that, you can specify an individual test method like this:
   220	
   221	.. console::
   222	
   223	   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings i18n.tests.TranslationTests.test_lazy_objects
   224	
   225	You can run tests starting at a specified top-level module with ``--start-at``
   226	option. For example:
   227	
   228	.. console::
   229	
   230	   $ ./runtests.py --start-at=wsgi
   231	
   232	You can also run tests starting after a specified top-level module with
   233	``--start-after`` option. For example:
   234	
   235	.. console::
   236	
   237	   $ ./runtests.py --start-after=wsgi
   238	
   239	Note that the ``--reverse`` option doesn't impact on ``--start-at`` or
   240	``--start-after`` options. Moreover these options cannot be used with test
   241	labels.
   242	
   243	Running the Selenium tests
   244	--------------------------
   245	
   246	Some tests require Selenium and a Web browser. To run these tests, you must
   247	install the selenium_ package and run the tests with the
   248	``--selenium=<BROWSERS>`` option. For example, if you have Firefox and Google
   249	Chrome installed:
   250	
   251	.. console::
   252	
   253	   $ ./runtests.py --selenium=firefox,chrome
   254	
   255	See the `selenium.webdriver`_ package for the list of available browsers.
   256	
   257	Specifying ``--selenium`` automatically sets ``--tags=selenium`` to run only
   258	the tests that require selenium.
   259	
   260	Some browsers (e.g. Chrome or Firefox) support headless testing, which can be
   261	faster and more stable. Add the ``--headless`` option to enable this mode.
   262	
   263	.. _selenium.webdriver: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/master/py/selenium/webdriver
   264	
   265	.. _running-unit-tests-dependencies:
   266	
   267	Running all the tests
   268	---------------------
   269	
   270	If you want to run the full suite of tests, you'll need to install a number of
   271	dependencies:
   272	
   273	*  argon2-cffi_ 16.1.0+
   274	*  asgiref_ 3.2+ (required)
   275	*  bcrypt_
   276	*  docutils_
   277	*  geoip2_
   278	*  jinja2_ 2.7+
   279	*  numpy_
   280	*  Pillow_ 6.2.0+
   281	*  PyYAML_
   282	*  pytz_ (required)
   283	*  pywatchman_
   284	*  setuptools_
   285	*  memcached_, plus a :ref:`supported Python binding <memcached>`
   286	*  gettext_ (:ref:`gettext_on_windows`)
   287	*  selenium_
   288	*  sqlparse_ 0.2.2+ (required)
   289	*  tblib_ 1.5.0+
   290	
   291	You can find these dependencies in `pip requirements files`_ inside the
   292	``tests/requirements`` directory of the Django source tree and install them
   293	like so:
   294	
   295	.. console::
   296	
   297	   $ python -m pip install -r tests/requirements/py3.txt
   298	
   299	If you encounter an error during the installation, your system might be missing
   300	a dependency for one or more of the Python packages. Consult the failing
   301	package's documentation or search the Web with the error message that you
   302	encounter.
   303	
   304	You can also install the database adapter(s) of your choice using
   305	``oracle.txt``, ``mysql.txt``, or ``postgres.txt``.
   306	
   307	If you want to test the memcached cache backend, you'll also need to define
   308	a :setting:`CACHES` setting that points at your memcached instance.
   309	
   310	To run the GeoDjango tests, you will need to :doc:`setup a spatial database
   311	and install the Geospatial libraries</ref/contrib/gis/install/index>`.
   312	
   313	Each of these dependencies is optional. If you're missing any of them, the
   314	associated tests will be skipped.
   315	
   316	To run some of the autoreload tests, you'll need to install the Watchman_
   317	service.

   339	Code coverage
   340	-------------
   341	
   342	Contributors are encouraged to run coverage on the test suite to identify areas
   343	that need additional tests. The coverage tool installation and use is described
   344	in :ref:`testing code coverage<topics-testing-code-coverage>`.
   345	
   346	Coverage should be run in a single process to obtain accurate statistics. To
   347	run coverage on the Django test suite using the standard test settings:
   348	
   349	.. console::
   350	
   351	   $ coverage run ./runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite --parallel=1
   352	
   353	After running coverage, generate the html report by running:
   354	
   355	.. console::
   356	
   357	   $ coverage html
   358	
   359	When running coverage for the Django tests, the included ``.coveragerc``
   360	settings file  defines ``coverage_html`` as the output directory for the report
   361	and also excludes several directories not relevant to the results
   362	(test code or external code included in Django).
   363	
   364	.. _contrib-apps:
   365	
   366	Contrib apps
   367	============
   368	
   369	Tests for contrib apps can be found in the ``tests/`` directory, typically
   370	under ``<app_name>_tests``. For example, tests for ``contrib.auth`` are located
   371	in ``tests/auth_tests``.
   372	
   373	.. _troubleshooting-unit-tests:
   374	
   375	Troubleshooting
   376	===============
   377	
   378	Test suite hangs or shows failures on ``master`` branch
   379	-------------------------------------------------------
   380	
   381	Ensure you have the latest point release of a :ref:`supported Python version
   382	<faq-python-version-support>`, since there are often bugs in earlier versions
   383	that may cause the test suite to fail or hang.
   384	
   385	On **macOS** (High Sierra and newer versions), you might see this message
   386	logged, after which the tests hang::
   387	
   388	    objc[42074]: +[__NSPlaceholderDate initialize] may have been in progress in
   389	    another thread when fork() was called.
   390	
   391	To avoid this set a ``OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY`` environment
   392	variable, for example::
   393	
   394	    $ OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES ./runtests.py
   395	
   396	Or add ``export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES`` to your shell's
   397	startup file (e.g. ``~/.profile``).
   398	
   399	Many test failures with ``UnicodeEncodeError``
   400	----------------------------------------------
   401	
   402	If the ``locales`` package is not installed, some tests will fail with a
   403	``UnicodeEncodeError``.
   404	
   405	You can resolve this on Debian-based systems, for example, by running:
   406	
   407	.. code-block:: console
   408	
   409	    $ apt-get install locales
   410	    $ dpkg-reconfigure locales
   411	
   412	You can resolve this for macOS systems by configuring your shell's locale:
   413	
   414	.. code-block:: console
   415	
   416	    $ export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
   417	    $ export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
   418	
   419	Run the ``locale`` command to confirm the change. Optionally, add those export
   420	commands to your shell's startup file (e.g. ``~/.bashrc`` for Bash) to avoid
   421	having to retype them.
   422	
   423	Tests that only fail in combination
   424	-----------------------------------
   425	
   426	In case a test passes when run in isolation but fails within the whole suite,
   427	we have some tools to help analyze the problem.
   428	
   429	The ``--bisect`` option of ``runtests.py`` will run the failing test while
   430	halving the test set it is run together with on each iteration, often making
   431	it possible to identify a small number of tests that may be related to the
   432	failure.
   433	
   434	For example, suppose that the failing test that works on its own is
   435	``ModelTest.test_eq``, then using:
   436	
   437	.. console::
   438	
   439	    $ ./runtests.py --bisect basic.tests.ModelTest.test_eq
   440	
   441	will try to determine a test that interferes with the given one. First, the
   442	test is run with the first half of the test suite. If a failure occurs, the
   443	first half of the test suite is split in two groups and each group is then run
   444	with the specified test. If there is no failure with the first half of the test
   445	suite, the second half of the test suite is run with the specified test and
   446	split appropriate<response clipped><NOTE>Due to the max output limit, only part of this file has been shown to you. You should retry this tool after you have searched inside the file with `grep -n` in order to find the line numbers of what you are looking for.</NOTE>


================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The documentation provides clear instructions for running tests. I'll follow the "Quickstart" section and the "Running tests using `tox`" section. Since the environment is already set up, I will focus on the test execution steps.

**Phase 2. RUNNING:**
1.  Navigate to the `tests` directory.
2.  Install requirements using `python -m pip install -e ..` and `python -m pip install -r requirements/py3.txt`. (The problem description says the environment is already set up, so I will try to skip these steps first. If tests fail due to missing dependencies, I will revisit this.)
3.  Run tests using `./runtests.py`.

Alternatively, I can use `tox`:
1.  Install `tox`: `python -m pip install tox` (again, I'll try to skip this first).
2.  Run `tox`.

I'll start by attempting to run `tox` directly, as it seems to be the recommended way to run the full suite and other checks. I'll navigate to the root of the repository first.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The `tox` run failed with several `ERROR` messages related to incorrectly sorted imports and `isort` failures, along with some actual test failures indicated by `F`s. These import and formatting issues are likely linting errors and not the core problem I need to solve. My priority is to address the docstring rendering issue.

I will now locate the actual test failures (marked by `F`) in the `tox` output to identify tests relevant to the `admindoc` functionality. This will help me confirm the bug and create a focused reproduction script. I'll search the execution result for "FAIL:".

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/django__django__3.1
</uploaded_files>

I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__3.1. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
docutils reports an error rendering view docstring when the first line is not empty
Description
	
Currently admindoc works correctly only with docstrings where the first line is empty, and all Django docstrings are formatted in this way.
However usually the docstring text starts at the first line, e.g.:
def test():
	"""test tests something.
	"""
and this cause an error:
Error in "default-role" directive:
no content permitted.
.. default-role:: cmsreference
The culprit is this code in trim_docstring:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
The problem is that the indentation of the first line is 0.
The solution is to skip the first line:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
Thanks.

</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/django__django__3.1 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.

Follow these phases to resolve the issue:

Phase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms
   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.
   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.
   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.
   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.
   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
<function=think>
<parameter=thought>
I will now begin Phase 1. READING.

1.1. **Code/Config Snippets and Conventions:**
The issue description provides a code snippet of a Python function `test()` with a docstring:
```python
def test():
    """test tests something.
    """
```
And a problematic code snippet from `trim_docstring`:
```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
```
The proposed solution is:
```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
```

The issue description mentions that "all Django docstrings are formatted in this way" (meaning, the first line is empty), which implies a convention within the Django project where docstrings start with an empty line. However, standard Python docstring best practices (PEP 257) suggest the summary line can be on the first line.

1.2. **Highlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details:**
- **Error message:** "Error in "default-role" directive: no content permitted. .. default-role:: cmsreference"
- **Method name:** `trim_docstring`
- **Variable:** `indent`
- **Problematic code line:** `indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())`
- **Proposed fix:** `indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())`
- **Technical detail:** "the indentation of the first line is 0"
- **Context:** `admindoc` and `docutils`

1.3. **Explain the problem in clear terms:**
The `admindoc` feature in Django uses `docutils` to render docstrings. There's a problem when a docstring's first line is not empty (i.e., the actual text starts on the first line, not after an initial blank line). The `trim_docstring` function, which calculates the indentation level of the docstring to strip it uniformly, incorrectly considers the first line of the docstring. If the first line is not empty and has zero indentation, it causes the `min()` function to evaluate `indent` as 0. This incorrect indentation calculation leads to a `docutils` error because `docutils` expects content after a directive, and the faulty indentation might cause it to misinterpret the docstring structure. Specifically, the `default-role` directive seems to be affected, complaining about "no content permitted."

1.4. **Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem:**
1. Create a Python function (or any code that uses a docstring) where the docstring's first line is not empty, e.g., `"""test tests something."""`.
2. Use `admindoc` to render this docstring.
3. Observe the `Error in "default-role" directive: no content permitted. .. default-role:: cmsreference` error.

1.5. **Highlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue:**
- The fix should only modify the `trim_docstring` function to correctly calculate indentation by ignoring the first line of the docstring.
- The change should be minimal and focused.
- Ensure the fix doesn't break existing docstring rending that follows the Django convention (empty first line).
- The solution should handle docstrings with varying indentation correctly.
- Ensure only non-test files are modified.

     1	======
     2	Django
     3	======
     4	
     5	Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
     6	and clean, pragmatic design. Thanks for checking it out.
     7	
     8	All documentation is in the "``docs``" directory and online at
     9	https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. If you're just getting started,
    10	here's how we recommend you read the docs:
    11	
    12	* First, read ``docs/intro/install.txt`` for instructions on installing Django.
    13	
    14	* Next, work through the tutorials in order (``docs/intro/tutorial01.txt``,
    15	  ``docs/intro/tutorial02.txt``, etc.).
    16	
    17	* If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read
    18	  ``docs/howto/deployment/index.txt`` for instructions.
    19	
    20	* You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in ``docs/topics``)
    21	  next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in ``docs/howto``) for specific
    22	  problems, and check out the reference (``docs/ref``) for gory details.
    23	
    24	* See ``docs/README`` for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.
    25	
    26	Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think
    27	they should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a
    28	ticket here: https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket
    29	
    30	To get more help:
    31	
    32	* Join the ``#django`` channel on irc.freenode.net. Lots of helpful people hang
    33	  out there. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IRC/Tutorial if you're
    34	  new to IRC.
    35	
    36	* Join the django-users mailing list, or read the archives, at
    37	  https://groups.google.com/group/django-users.
    38	
    39	To contribute to Django:
    40	
    41	* Check out https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/ for
    42	  information about getting involved.
    43	
    44	To run Django's test suite:
    45	
    46	* Follow the instructions in the "Unit tests" section of
    47	  ``docs/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests.txt``, published online at
    48	  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-the-unit-tests
    49

Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__3.1/docs/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests.txt:
     1	==========
     2	Unit tests
     3	==========
     4	
     5	Django comes with a test suite of its own, in the ``tests`` directory of the
     6	code base. It's our policy to make sure all tests pass at all times.
     7	
     8	We appreciate any and all contributions to the test suite!
     9	
    10	The Django tests all use the testing infrastructure that ships with Django for
    11	testing applications. See :doc:`/topics/testing/overview` for an explanation of
    12	how to write new tests.
    13	
    14	.. _running-unit-tests:
    15	
    16	Running the unit tests
    17	======================
    18	
    19	Quickstart
    20	----------
    21	
    22	First, `fork Django on GitHub <https://github.com/django/django/fork>`__.
    23	
    24	Second, create and activate a virtual environment. If you're not familiar with
    25	how to do that, read our :doc:`contributing tutorial </intro/contributing>`.
    26	
    27	Next, clone your fork, install some requirements, and run the tests:
    28	
    29	.. console::
    30	
    31	   $ git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubName/django.git django-repo
    32	   $ cd django-repo/tests
    33	   $ python -m pip install -e ..
    34	   $ python -m pip install -r requirements/py3.txt
    35	   $ ./runtests.py
    36	
    37	Installing the requirements will likely require some operating system packages
    38	that your computer doesn't have installed. You can usually figure out which
    39	package to install by doing a Web search for the last line or so of the error
    40	message. Try adding your operating system to the search query if needed.
    41	
    42	If you have trouble installing the requirements, you can skip that step. See
    43	:ref:`running-unit-tests-dependencies` for details on installing the optional
    44	test dependencies. If you don't have an optional dependency installed, the
    45	tests that require it will be skipped.
    46	
    47	Running the tests requires a Django settings module that defines the databases
    48	to use. To help you get started, Django provides and uses a sample settings
    49	module that uses the SQLite database. See :ref:`running-unit-tests-settings` to
    50	learn how to use a different settings module to run the tests with a different
    51	database.
    52	
    53	Having problems? See :ref:`troubleshooting-unit-tests` for some common issues.
    54	
    55	Running tests using ``tox``
    56	---------------------------
    57	
    58	`Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a tool for running tests in different
    59	virtual environments. Django includes a basic ``tox.ini`` that automates some
    60	checks that our build server performs on pull requests. To run the unit tests
    61	and other checks (such as :ref:`import sorting <coding-style-imports>`, the
    62	:ref:`documentation spelling checker <documentation-spelling-check>`, and
    63	:ref:`code formatting <coding-style-python>`), install and run the ``tox``
    64	command from any place in the Django source tree:
    65	
    66	.. console::
    67	
    68	    $ python -m pip install tox
    69	    $ tox
    70	
    71	By default, ``tox`` runs the test suite with the bundled test settings file for
    72	SQLite, ``flake8``, ``isort``, and the documentation spelling checker. In
    73	addition to the system dependencies noted elsewhere in this documentation,
    74	the command ``python3`` must be on your path and linked to the appropriate
    75	version of Python. A list of default environments can be seen as follows:
    76	
    77	.. console::
    78	
    79	    $ tox -l
    80	    py3
    81	    flake8
    82	    docs
    83	    isort
    84	
    85	Testing other Python versions and database backends
    86	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    87	
    88	In addition to the default environments, ``tox`` supports running unit tests
    89	for other versions of Python and other database backends. Since Django's test
    90	suite doesn't bundle a settings file for database backends other than SQLite,
    91	however, you must :ref:`create and provide your own test settings
    92	<running-unit-tests-settings>`. For example, to run the tests on Python 3.7
    93	using PostgreSQL:
    94	
    95	.. console::
    96	
    97	    $ tox -e py37-postgres -- --settings=my_postgres_settings
    98	
    99	This command sets up a Python 3.7 virtual environment, installs Django's
   100	test suite dependencies (including those for PostgreSQL), and calls
   101	``runtests.py`` with the supplied arguments (in this case,
   102	``--settings=my_postgres_settings``).
   103	
   104	The remainder of this documentation shows commands for running tests without
   105	``tox``, however, any option passed to ``runtests.py`` can also be passed to
   106	``tox`` by prefixing the argument list with ``--``, as above.
   107	
   108	Tox also respects the ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable, if set.
   109	For example, the following is equivalent to the command above:
   110	
   111	.. code-block:: console
   112	
   113	    $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=my_postgres_settings tox -e py35-postgres
   114	
   115	Windows users should use:
   116	
   117	.. code-block:: doscon
   118	
   119	    ...\> set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=my_postgres_settings
   120	    ...\> tox -e py35-postgres
   121	
   122	Running the JavaScript tests
   123	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   124	
   125	Django includes a set of :ref:`JavaScript unit tests <javascript-tests>` for
   126	functions in certain contrib apps. The JavaScript tests aren't run by default
   127	using ``tox`` because they require `Node.js` to be installed and aren't
   128	necessary for the majority of patches. To run the JavaScript tests using
   129	``tox``:
   130	
   131	.. console::
   132	
   133	    $ tox -e javascript
   134	
   135	This command runs ``npm install`` to ensure test requirements are up to
   136	date and then runs ``npm test``.
   137	
   138	Running tests using ``django-docker-box``
   139	-----------------------------------------
   140	
   141	`django-docker-box`_ allows you to run the Django's test suite across all
   142	supported databases and python versions. See the `django-docker-box`_ project
   143	page for installation and usage instructions.
   144	
   145	.. _django-docker-box: https://github.com/django/django-docker-box
   146	
   147	.. _running-unit-tests-settings:
   148	
   149	Using another ``settings`` module
   150	---------------------------------
   151	
   152	The included settings module (``tests/test_sqlite.py``) allows you to run the
   153	test suite using SQLite. If you want to run the tests using a different
   154	database, you'll need to define your own settings file. Some tests, such as
   155	those for ``contrib.postgres``, are specific to a particular database backend
   156	and will be skipped if run with a different backend.
   157	
   158	To run the tests with different settings, ensure that the module is on your
   159	``PYTHONPATH`` and pass the module with ``--settings``.
   160	
   161	The :setting:`DATABASES` setting in any test settings module needs to define
   162	two databases:
   163	
   164	* A ``default`` database. This database should use the backend that
   165	  you want to use for primary testing.
   166	
   167	* A database with the alias ``other``. The ``other`` database is used to test
   168	  that queries can be directed to different databases. This database should use
   169	  the same backend as the ``default``, and it must have a different name.
   170	
   171	If you're using a backend that isn't SQLite, you will need to provide other
   172	details for each database:
   173	
   174	* The :setting:`USER` option needs to specify an existing user account
   175	  for the database. That user needs permission to execute ``CREATE DATABASE``
   176	  so that the test database can be created.
   177	
   178	* The :setting:`PASSWORD` option needs to provide the password for
   179	  the :setting:`USER` that has been specified.
   180	
   181	Test databases get their names by prepending ``test_`` to the value of the
   182	:setting:`NAME` settings for the databases defined in :setting:`DATABASES`.
   183	These test databases are deleted when the tests are finished.
   184	
   185	You will also need to ensure that your database uses UTF-8 as the default
   186	character set. If your database server doesn't use UTF-8 as a default charset,
   187	you will need to include a value for :setting:`CHARSET <TEST_CHARSET>` in the
   188	test settings dictionary for the applicable database.
   189	
   190	.. _runtests-specifying-labels:
   191	
   192	Running only some of the tests
   193	------------------------------
   194	
   195	Django's entire test suite takes a while to run, and running every single test
   196	could be redundant if, say, you just added a test to Django that you want to
   197	run quickly without running everything else. You can run a subset of the unit
   198	tests by appending the names of the test modules to ``runtests.py`` on the
   199	command line.
   200	
   201	For example, if you'd like to run tests only for generic relations and
   202	internationalization, type:
   203	
   204	.. console::
   205	
   206	   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings generic_relations i18n
   207	
   208	How do you find out the names of individual tests? Look in ``tests/`` — each
   209	directory name there is the name of a test.
   210	
   211	If you want to run only a particular class of tests, you can specify a list of
   212	paths to individual test classes. For example, to run the ``TranslationTests``
   213	of the ``i18n`` module, type:
   214	
   215	.. console::
   216	
   217	   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings i18n.tests.TranslationTests
   218	
   219	Going beyond that, you can specify an individual test method like this:
   220	
   221	.. console::
   222	
   223	   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings i18n.tests.TranslationTests.test_lazy_objects
   224	
   225	You can run tests starting at a specified top-level module with ``--start-at``
   226	option. For example:
   227	
   228	.. console::
   229	
   230	   $ ./runtests.py --start-at=wsgi
   231	
   232	You can also run tests starting after a specified top-level module with
   233	``--start-after`` option. For example:
   234	
   235	.. console::
   236	
   237	   $ ./runtests.py --start-after=wsgi
   238	
   239	Note that the ``--reverse`` option doesn't impact on ``--start-at`` or
   240	``--start-after`` options. Moreover these options cannot be used with test
   241	labels.
   242	
   243	Running the Selenium tests
   244	--------------------------
   245	
   246	Some tests require Selenium and a Web browser. To run these tests, you must
   247	install the selenium_ package and run the tests with the
   248	``--selenium=<BROWSERS>`` option. For example, if you have Firefox and Google
   249	Chrome installed:
   250	
   251	.. console::
   252	
   253	   $ ./runtests.py --selenium=firefox,chrome
   254	
   255	See the `selenium.webdriver`_ package for the list of available browsers.
   256	
   257	Specifying ``--selenium`` automatically sets ``--tags=selenium`` to run only
   258	the tests that require selenium.
   259	
   260	Some browsers (e.g. Chrome or Firefox) support headless testing, which can be
   261	faster and more stable. Add the ``--headless`` option to enable this mode.
   262	
   263	.. _selenium.webdriver: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/master/py/selenium/webdriver
   264	
   265	.. _running-unit-tests-dependencies:
   266	
   267	Running all the tests
   268	---------------------
   269	
   270	If you want to run the full suite of tests, you'll need to install a number of
   271	dependencies:
   272	
   273	*  argon2-cffi_ 16.1.0+
   274	*  asgiref_ 3.2+ (required)
   275	*  bcrypt_
   276	*  docutils_
   277	*  geoip2_
   278	*  jinja2_ 2.7+
   279	*  numpy_
   280	*  Pillow_ 6.2.0+
   281	*  PyYAML_
   282	*  pytz_ (required)
   283	*  pywatchman_
   284	*  setuptools_
   285	*  memcached_, plus a :ref:`supported Python binding <memcached>`
   286	*  gettext_ (:ref:`gettext_on_windows`)
   287	*  selenium_
   288	*  sqlparse_ 0.2.2+ (required)
   289	*  tblib_ 1.5.0+
   290	
   291	You can find these dependencies in `pip requirements files`_ inside the
   292	``tests/requirements`` directory of the Django source tree and install them
   293	like so:
   294	
   295	.. console::
   296	
   297	   $ python -m pip install -r tests/requirements/py3.txt
   298	
   299	If you encounter an error during the installation, your system might be missing
   300	a dependency for one or more of the Python packages. Consult the failing
   301	package's documentation or search the Web with the error message that you
   302	encounter.
   303	
   304	You can also install the database adapter(s) of your choice using
   305	``oracle.txt``, ``mysql.txt``, or ``postgres.txt``.
   306	
   307	If you want to test the memcached cache backend, you'll also need to define
   308	a :setting:`CACHES` setting that points at your memcached instance.
   309	
   310	To run the GeoDjango tests, you will need to :doc:`setup a spatial database
   311	and install the Geospatial libraries</ref/contrib/gis/install/index>`.
   312	
   313	Each of these dependencies is optional. If you're missing any of them, the
   314	associated tests will be skipped.
   315	
   316	To run some of the autoreload tests, you'll need to install the Watchman_
   317	service.

   339	Code coverage
   340	-------------
   341	
   342	Contributors are encouraged to run coverage on the test suite to identify areas
   343	that need additional tests. The coverage tool installation and use is described
   344	in :ref:`testing code coverage<topics-testing-code-coverage>`.
   345	
   346	Coverage should be run in a single process to obtain accurate statistics. To
   347	run coverage on the Django test suite using the standard test settings:
   348	
   349	.. console::
   350	
   351	   $ coverage run ./runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite --parallel=1
   352	
   353	After running coverage, generate the html report by running:
   354	
   355	.. console::
   356	
   357	   $ coverage html
   358	
   359	When running coverage for the Django tests, the included ``.coveragerc``
   360	settings file  defines ``coverage_html`` as the output directory for the report
   361	and also excludes several directories not relevant to the results
   362	(test code or external code included in Django).
   363	
   364	.. _contrib-apps:
   365	
   366	Contrib apps
   367	============
   368	
   369	Tests for contrib apps can be found in the ``tests/`` directory, typically
   370	under ``<app_name>_tests``. For example, tests for ``contrib.auth`` are located
   371	in ``tests/auth_tests``.
   372	
   373	.. _troubleshooting-unit-tests:
   374	
   375	Troubleshooting
   376	===============
   377	
   378	Test suite hangs or shows failures on ``master`` branch
   379	-------------------------------------------------------
   380	
   381	Ensure you have the latest point release of a :ref:`supported Python version
   382	<faq-python-version-support>`, since there are often bugs in earlier versions
   383	that may cause the test suite to fail or hang.
   384	
   385	On **macOS** (High Sierra and newer versions), you might see this message
   386	logged, after which the tests hang::
   387	
   388	    objc[42074]: +[__NSPlaceholderDate initialize] may have been in progress in
   389	    another thread when fork() was called.
   390	
   391	To avoid this set a ``OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY`` environment
   392	variable, for example::
   393	
   394	    $ OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES ./runtests.py
   395	
   396	Or add ``export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES`` to your shell's
   397	startup file (e.g. ``~/.profile``).
   398	
   399	Many test failures with ``UnicodeEncodeError``
   400	----------------------------------------------
   401	
   402	If the ``locales`` package is not installed, some tests will fail with a
   403	``UnicodeEncodeError``.
   404	
   405	You can resolve this on Debian-based systems, for example, by running:
   406	
   407	.. code-block:: console
   408	
   409	    $ apt-get install locales
   410	    $ dpkg-reconfigure locales
   411	
   412	You can resolve this for macOS systems by configuring your shell's locale:
   413	
   414	.. code-block:: console
   415	
   416	    $ export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
   417	    $ export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
   418	
   419	Run the ``locale`` command to confirm the change. Optionally, add those export
   420	commands to your shell's startup file (e.g. ``~/.bashrc`` for Bash) to avoid
   421	having to retype them.
   422	
   423	Tests that only fail in combination
   424	-----------------------------------
   425	
   426	In case a test passes when run in isolation but fails within the whole suite,
   427	we have some tools to help analyze the problem.
   428	
   429	The ``--bisect`` option of ``runtests.py`` will run the failing test while
   430	halving the test set it is run together with on each iteration, often making
   431	it possible to identify a small number of tests that may be related to the
   432	failure.
   433	
   434	For example, suppose that the failing test that works on its own is
   435	``ModelTest.test_eq``, then using:
   436	
   437	.. console::
   438	
   439	    $ ./runtests.py --bisect basic.tests.ModelTest.test_eq
   440	
   441	will try to determine a test that interferes with the given one. First, the
   442	test is run with the first half of the test suite. If a failure occurs, the
   443	first half of the test suite is split in two groups and each group is then run
   444	with the specified test. If there is no failure with the first half of the test
   445	suite, the second half of the test suite is run with the specified test and
   446	split appropriate<response clipped><NOTE>Due to the max output limit, only part of this file has been shown to you. You should retry this tool after you have searched inside the file with `grep -n` in order to find the line numbers of what you are looking for.</NOTE>

RESPONSE:
<function=think>
<parameter=thought>
I have read the `unit-tests.txt` file. The quickstart section provides the following commands to run the tests:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubName/django.git django-repo
$ cd django-repo/tests
$ python -m pip install -e ..
$ python -m pip install -r requirements/py3.txt
$ ./runtests.py
```

I am already in the `django__django__3.1` directory, which is the repository root. So I should adapt the commands:

1. `cd tests` (already in the root, so `cd` into `tests`)
2. `python -m pip install -e ..` (install Django in editable mode)
3. `python -m pip install -r requirements/py3.txt` (install test dependencies)
4. `./runtests.py` (run the tests)

However, the problem description states that "the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages." This means I can skip steps 2 and 3 and directly run `./runtests.py` from the `tests` directory.

I will first `cd` into the `tests` directory and then run `./runtests.py`.

LAST RESPONSE:
<function=think>
<parameter=thought>
The tests ran and 7 tests failed. However, the task description states: "I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!" And, "Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/django__django__3.1 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied."

This implies that the current failing tests are either unrelated to the issue I need to fix, or they are expected to fail until the fix is implemented. Since I'm not supposed to modify test files, I will proceed with finding the `trim_docstring` function and implementing the proposed fix. I will rely on creating a separate reproduction script for the specific issue as instructed in Phase 4.

I will now begin Phase 3. EXPLORATION.

3.1. Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.
3.2. Identify all files related to the problem statement.
3.3. Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.
3.4. From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.

I will use `grep` to find the `trim_docstring` function. I'll search within the `django` directory.
